# üß¨ AR Biology Visualizer (SARA) ‚Äì Final Integrations & Refinements

## 1. Focus üß†
This week, the team focused on refining the core user interactions, integrating the second 3D model, and preparing for the final merge before the submission of the SARA AR project. The work revolved around improving the app‚Äôs polish, consistency, and extensibility ‚Äî making sure the system could handle multiple models and unified input behavior across all interactive features.

## 2. Progress üíª

**Alejandro & Samuele ‚Äì Rotation Smoothing, Restart Functionality, and Model Expansion**  
Alejandro and Samuele implemented several key improvements to the project‚Äôs interactivity. The rotation system was refined to achieve smoother and more natural movement, while a dedicated restart button was introduced to return the 3D model to its original position and scale after manipulation. Additionally, the team successfully integrated a new 3D kidney model into the application, confirming that the system supports multiple anatomical objects using the same foundational scripts and logic.

**Eliza ‚Äì Annotations, Aesthetics, and Final Preparation**  
Eliza completed her refinement of the annotation system, ensuring that the visual cues and interactions are both functional and visually coherent. She also enhanced the overall aesthetics of her features, aligning them with the rest of the interface. With her refinements complete, she is now preparing her final merge into the main branch, ready to integrate with the unified version of the app.

**Ginta ‚Äì Merge Conflict Resolution & Input Standardization**  
After resolving multiple merge conflicts between her branch and the main project, Ginta successfully merged her latest work into main. Her main contribution this week was to help standardize touch interaction behaviors across the project, ensuring both rotation and zoom functionalities were consistent and compatible with the new scripts.

## 3. Challenges ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Unity instability** continued to affect Samuele‚Äôs local setup, forcing him to collaborate closely with Alejandro using the same machine. This challenge is visible in their co-authored GitHub commits.  
- **Merge conflicts** delayed progress slightly, especially for Ginta, but these were successfully resolved after careful version tracking and communication.  
- The **final integration phase** required extra coordination to ensure all scripts (rotation, zoom, annotations) worked harmoniously across different prefabs and tracked images.

## 4. Next Steps üöÄ

- Merge Eliza‚Äôs finalized annotation and interface features into the main branch.  
- Conduct final testing across both anatomical models (skull and kidney) to confirm functionality and stability.  
- Optimize visual alignment, model scale, and responsiveness before packaging the final build.  
- Prepare the project for final demonstration and documentation.

## 5. Reflection üí¨
This week‚Äôs work reflected a mature stage in the team‚Äôs development cycle ‚Äî a focus on **refinement, cohesion, and resilience**. The successful addition of a new 3D model demonstrated the scalability of the system the team designed. Despite recurring technical challenges, collaboration proved to be a powerful asset: shared problem-solving, co-authored code, and structured version control allowed the team to maintain progress without significant setbacks.

The integration phase tested not only technical skill but also communication and adaptability. Each member contributed to ensuring that the final AR experience feels polished, consistent, and educationally valuable. The SARA project now stands as a cohesive and functional AR prototype ready for final assembly and evaluation.
