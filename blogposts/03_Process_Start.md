# 🧠 AR Biology Visualizer AKA... SARA!

## 1. Goals  🎯
Start developing the AR biology app by learning the basics of Unity, set up our main scene, and split up the work based on our use cases.  

---

## 2. Progress  💻
During this session, the team became more familiar with Unity as a development environment. 

Since none of us had taken the prerequisite Unity course, we needed some time to understand some of the basics, like setting up the project, creating prefabs, and working with Unity managers etc. By the end of the session, we didn’t yet have working functionality, but we made progress in:  

- Setting up the main AR scene (camera, lighting, test objects).  
- Importing and organizing anatomy models.  
- Choosing a model to start with (the skull) and creating a prefab for it.  
- Outlining the first scripts we’ll need.

Additionally, we came up with a fun name for our project/app - **SARA**, which stands for Scannable AR Anatomy! 🤓 *(We love our acronyms and that's okay)*

## 3. Task Distribution  ✔️
We divided the work on SARA between the group members based on our use cases, and created separate branches for each part:  

- **Move, Zoom, Rotate Interactions** → *Ginta & Alejandro*  
  - Related to **UC3 – Position, Rotate, and Zoom Model**  

- **QR Code Scanning / Model Loading** → *Samuele*  
  - Related to **UC1 – Access Models** and **UC2 – View Anatomy Models**  

- **Annotations & Descriptions** → *Eliza*  
  - Related to **UC4 – Dissect Anatomy Models** and **UC5 – Access Detailed Descriptions**

## 4. Challenges  ⚕️
 - **Unity Learning Curve:** Setting up prefabs, managers, and AR functionality required extra time since this was new to the entire group.
 - **Branch Setup:** Coordinating the project and work across multiple branches introduced some Git-related challenges.
 - **Scripts & Managers:** Understanding which managers (AR session manager, interaction manager, annotation handler, etc.) are needed took time to figure out.
 - **Buggy Application:** Some of our members also struggled with issues in the setup of their Unity application, which took time away from development.

## 5. Next Steps  👣
1. Get the move/zoom/rotate interactions working.  
2. Make QR code scanning load the correct model in AR.  
3. Add annotations and connect them with model parts.  
4. Start merging branches into a shared scene.  
5. Keep optimizing the models so they run smoothly on mobile.

## 6. Reflection  📱
Even though we do not have any of the functionality working yet, we now understand Unity better and have a clearer idea of how the app should come together. 
Splitting up the use cases into tasks and branches has made the workload more manageable, and ensured we can work on different parts of the functionality simultaneously.

Additionally, despite the challenges, it has been a quite fun and interesting process, and we are excited to see how our app will look when we are done with it. ⭐
