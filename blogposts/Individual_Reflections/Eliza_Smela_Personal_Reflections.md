**Contributions to the project**

- Initiated the AR project from scratch by selecting and configuring a suitable Unity + AR Foundation project template
- Developed interactive hotspots attached to 3D models, allowing users to tap specific anatomical points to trigger contextual annotations
- Implemented clickable descriptions linked to hotspots, displaying structured textual explanations without breaking AR immersion

**Reflections**

The AR project formed a significant part of my XR development (XRD) learning experience and represented my first hands-on encounter with Unity. As I had no prior experience with Unity or AR development, the project initially felt challenging. However, I deliberately chose XRD to step outside my comfort zone, gain new technical skills, and strengthen my professional portfolio. This mindset strongly influenced how I approached the AR project from the beginning.

Our team consisted of four members, none of whom had prior Unity experience, which made the learning curve steep for everyone involved. To prepare myself, I independently explored Unity before the course officially started by following built-in learning paths such as the Roll a Ball tutorial. Even after a few hours of practice, I felt more confident navigating the Unity environment, which helped me contribute more effectively once group work began.

When development of the AR application started, the group shared a strong motivation to create something educational, creative, and technically achievable within the project timeframe. This led to the idea of SARA, an AR application designed to support medical students who may struggle to visualize anatomical structures early in their studies. While the concept was relatively simple, the implementation required careful planning and continuous refinement.

Over time, the project evolved from a basic prototype into a more advanced application that allowed users to scan an image of an organ, manipulate it through rotation and physical movement, interact with annotated hotspots, and access detailed descriptions of individual anatomical elements. Each group meeting focused on incremental improvements, ensuring that functionality, usability, and visual clarity were consistently enhanced.

Because this was our final semester and in-person meetings were limited, we divided responsibilities early and agreed on weekly meetings to synchronize progress. GitHub was used for version control, and changes were merged toward the end of development. Overall, the AR workflow was smooth and well-structured. I particularly enjoyed the creative aspects of the project, as visual design, spatial placement, and interaction design played a central role in shaping the user experience.

The AR project was a highly positive and rewarding experience. Despite starting with no Unity background, I was able to quickly build confidence and actively contribute to a functional and educational AR application. The project strengthened my technical skills, improved my understanding of AR interaction design, and reinforced the value of early preparation and structured collaboration. Most importantly, it demonstrated how even a simple concept can become a meaningful learning tool when thoughtfully designed and iteratively developed.
