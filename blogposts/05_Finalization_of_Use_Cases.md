# AR Biology Visualizer (SARA) – Blogpost 5

## 1. Focus 🧠
This week, the team continued refining and integrating use case functionalities for the SARA AR application. With several major technical hurdles now overcome, development shifted toward improving interactivity and combining separate features into a unified, working AR experience.

## 2. Progress 💻
Each member made significant strides in their assigned areas:

Samuele & Alejandro – QR Code, Model Loading & Rotation
Samuele and Alejandro successfully merged Alejandro’s branch into the main project and resolved all related issues. Together, they achieved a major milestone: the 3D model now spawns on the detected QR code, follows the QR code’s movement, and rotates smoothly around a pivot. This represents a key step toward having a fully interactive AR scene.

Eliza – Annotations & Interactions
Eliza made excellent progress by fine-tuning the pulsing speed of the hotspots, ensuring they now pulse at a smooth, visually appealing rate. She also made the hotspots circular and responsive to user touch, adding an important layer of interactivity. Her next focus will be implementing the functionality where, upon tapping a hotspot, it expands to show a detailed description of the selected body part.

Ginta – Touch Interactions
Ginta spent the week working on getting touch functionality to register properly in Unity. While the issue persists, she is actively debugging the problem and verifying her code and input settings to ensure proper detection of touch gestures.

## 3. Challenges ⚙️

- Touch input not recognized on Ginta’s setup remains the primary unresolved issue.

- The team is still limited to two Android phones for testing and building, slowing progress slightly.

- Samuele’s Unity package errors continue to prevent him from working on his own device, so he collaborates using teammates’ setups.


## 4. Next Steps 🚀

- Ginta will continue troubleshooting and finalizing her touch interaction functionality.

- Once Ginta completes her part, it will be merged into the main branch, which already includes Samuele’s and Alejandro’s work.

- Eliza will then add and merge her annotation expansion feature for detailed body part descriptions.

- If time allows, the team will implement all functionalities on additional 3D models, which should be faster now that the base systems are stable.

## 5. Reflection 💬
This week marked a major breakthrough in integration and feature stability. The team successfully connected key systems—QR tracking, model spawning, and rotation—creating a cohesive interactive experience. Despite a few technical roadblocks, steady progress and teamwork are bringing the AR app closer to a complete, functional prototype ready for final testing and expansion.
