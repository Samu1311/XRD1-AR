#  ü´Ä AR Biology Visualizer ‚Äì Software Documentation

## 1. Goal
Create an AR mobile application that helps biology students learn complex structures by visualizing interactive 3D models (e.g., heart, brain, cells, digestive system) in their own environment.

---

## 2. Motivation
Traditional learning tools like textbooks or 2D images often fail to convey spatial and structural understanding.  
An AR application can bridge this gap by providing immersive, manipulable, and layered models that enhance comprehension and retention.

## 3. Actor
**Primary Actor:** Medical Student

## 4. Requirements

### Functional
1. Detect surfaces via AR plane detection.  
2. Allow placement of 3D models in real-world space.  
3. Enable interactions: pinch-to-zoom, rotate, drag/reposition.  
4. Explode/dissect view to show model parts.  
5. Show detailed description of organ parts.  
6. Display annotations via hotspots.  
7. Switch models through UI (heart, digestive system).  

### Non-Functional
8. Run on Android (mid-tier) and support iOS if possible.  
9. Maintain smooth performance.  
10. Models optimized for mobile AR: ‚â§50k polys, compressed textures.  
11. Clear, intuitive UI with minimal onboarding.  
12. Documentation and version control maintained consistently.  

---

## 5. User Stories
1. As a medical student, I want an easy way to access the model for learning purposes.  
2. As a medical student, I want to be able to view models depicting parts of human anatomy.  
3. As a medical student, I want to be able to rotate and position the model for a thorough examination.  
4. As a medical student, I want to be able to dissect the model to explore different parts of it by selecting them separately.  
5. As a medical student, I want to access a detailed description of the chosen part of the model.

## 6. Use Cases


### UC1 ‚Äì Access Models  

| **Item**          | **Description** |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Summary**       | Medical student quickly accesses anatomy models for studying. |
| **Actor**         | Medical Student |
| **Precondition**  | App installed, QR codes available, camera permission granted. |
| **Postcondition** | AR camera ready, models can be loaded. |

**Base Sequence**  
1. Student opens the app.  
2. System activates the camera.  
3. Student scans QR code.  
4. System recognizes QR code and prepares the corresponding model.  

**Exceptions**  
- Step 2a: Camera permission denied ‚Üí System shows error and prompts to enable camera.  
- Step 3a: QR code not recognized ‚Üí System shows error and prompts to rescan.  

**Notes:** Covers requirements 1, 2  

---

### UC2 ‚Äì View Anatomy Models  

| **Item**          | **Description** |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Summary**       | Medical students view 3D models of human organs. |
| **Actor**         | Medical Student |
| **Precondition**  | Student has scanned QR code. |
| **Postcondition** | Model is displayed and ready for interaction. |

**Base Sequence**  
1. System retrieves correct model.  
2. System displays model at target location via camera.  
3. Student confirms model appears correctly.  

**Exceptions**  
- Step 1a: Wrong model retrieved or failed ‚Üí User retries loading.  

**Notes:** Covers requirements 1, 2  

---

### UC3 ‚Äì Position, Rotate, and Zoom Model  

| **Item**          | **Description** |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Summary**       | Student manipulates a placed anatomy model to change its orientation and position. |
| **Actor**         | Medical Student |
| **Precondition**  | Device supports ARCore/ARKit; camera permission granted. AR session running with tracked plane. A model is placed and active. |
| **Postcondition** | Model‚Äôs position/rotation reflect user input within valid bounds. |

**Base Sequence**  
1. System shows placed model (highlight/reticle).  
2. User touches and drags model/plane.  
3. System raycasts to plane and updates model position.  
4. User performs two-finger twist gesture.  
5. System computes delta angle and rotates model.  
6. User releases touches.  
7. System confirms transform; optional haptic/UI feedback.  

**Exceptions**  
- Step 2: Gesture not recognized ‚Üí System ignores and prompts retry.  
- Step 3: Plane lost ‚Üí Model frozen at last position, ‚Äútracking lost‚Äù shown.  
- Step 4: Gesture misinterpreted (pinch vs twist) ‚Üí System prioritizes gesture, shows icon.  
- Step 5: Rotation angle exceeds bounds ‚Üí System clamps rotation, boundary cue displayed.  

**Notes:** Covers requirements 2, 3  

---

### UC4 ‚Äì Dissect Anatomy Models  

| **Item**          | **Description** |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Summary**       | Medical student dissects organ model into parts. |
| **Actor**         | Medical Student |
| **Precondition**  | Model is visible. |
| **Postcondition** | Anatomy model explodes into parts. |

**Base Sequence**  
1. User scans QR code.  
2. Organ model is displayed in AR.  
3. User taps organ.  
4. System explodes model into parts.  

**Exceptions**  
- Step 2a: Model fails to load ‚Üí System shows error message and prompts retry.  
- Step 3a: Tap not registered ‚Üí System ignores input, model remains whole.  

**Notes:** Covers requirements 4, 6, 7  

---

### UC5 ‚Äì Access Detailed Descriptions  

| **Item**          | **Description** |
