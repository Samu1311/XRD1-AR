# üß¨ AR Biology Visualizer (SARA) ‚Äì Blogpost 4

## 1. Focus üß†

This week, our main focus shifted from setting up Unity and the AR environment to actually **implementing and testing functionality** for each use case.  
With the scene, prefabs, and managers ready, everyone began working on the **interactive scripts and logic** that bring SARA to life.

## 2. Progress üíª

Each team member concentrated on the part of the app assigned earlier:

- **Samuele ‚Äì QR Code & Model Loading**  
  Samuele successfully got the **QR code scanning and model loading** to work.  
  However, he encountered **persistent issues with Unity missing packages and dependencies**, which made testing and committing changes difficult. He‚Äôs troubleshooting this with help from both the teacher and Unity‚Äôs documentation and the problem was not yet solved.

- **Eliza ‚Äì Annotations & Descriptions**  
  Eliza managed to get the **annotation and information display** working partially.  
  The main issue is that **information panels appear and disappear too quickly**, so further refinement is needed to stabilize how long tooltips remain visible. Despite this, the functionality for linking model parts with text is progressing well.

- **Ginta & Alejandro ‚Äì Move, Zoom, Rotate Interactions**  
  Both Ginta and Alejandro completed the **interaction scripts** for placing, rotating, and scaling the 3D models.  
  Unfortunately, **touch interactions were not being recognized properly on mobile devices**, meaning the scripts worked logically but not physically. More research is required to spot the problem.

## 3. Challenges ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Unity Package Errors:** Some devices showed missing AR or input system packages, making testing inconsistent across the team.
- **Touch & Interaction Issues:** The main scripts for manipulation did not yet respond to gestures as expected.
- **Testing Limitations:** Only **two Android phones** were available for the entire group, significantly slowing down testing progress.

## 4. Teacher Support üß©

The teacher was consulted during the week to clarify some problems and he advised on best practices for **ARFoundation setups** and package management to ensure all team members can run the same version of the project without missing dependencies.

## 5. Next Steps üöÄ

1. Fix touch recognition and gesture-based interaction scripts.
2. Continue debugging Eliza‚Äôs annotation timing.
3. Help Samuele resolve Unity package conflicts.
4. Start integrating all scripts into one working AR scene.
5. Optimize model performance before final testing and polishing.

## 6. Reflection üí¨

This week marked the transition from setup to **real functionality development**.  
Is true that technical issues have arisen but some progress has been able to be conducted, every member has their functionality working at least partially and extensive test and app building have been done increasing the overall team knowledge of Unity.
