# Alejandro Bautista – Individual Reflection (AR Project)

## Main Contributions

- Worked on **move, rotate, and scale interactions** for AR models together with Ginta  
- Implemented and refined **touch-based manipulation scripts** for AR objects  
- Assisted in integrating the **second anatomical model (kidney)** into the application  
- Collaborated closely with **Samuele on merging and integrating** the different branches into a single working AR application  
- Helped resolve **merge conflicts and integration bugs**, especially during later project stages  
- Participated in **testing and debugging** AR functionality on limited Android devices  
- Contributed to **final interaction refinements**, including smoother rotation behavior and restart functionality

## Reflection

### Learning Unity and AR Through Practice

At the start of this project, I had **no prior experience with Unity or AR development**. The course introduced us to the **different components that make up an AR application in Unity**, such as AR scenes, tracking, interaction scripts, prefabs, managers, and version control, without focusing on strict implementation patterns.

Because of this, most of my learning happened through **hands-on experimentation**, trial and error, and debugging. Early on, even basic tasks such as setting up prefabs or understanding AR managers required time. As the project progressed, these concepts became clearer through direct application.

This learning-by-doing approach helped me understand not just individual features, but how the different parts of an AR application depend on each other. A lot of courses and documentation had to be used so that i could understand the way that Unity worked.

### Working on AR Interactions

My main technical focus in this project was on **move, rotate, and scale interactions** for AR models. Together with Ginta, I worked on scripts that allowed users to manipulate 3D anatomy models using touch input.

While the interaction logic was implemented early, we encountered persistent issues with **touch recognition on mobile devices**. These challenges highlighted how AR development depends heavily on correct configuration and testing on real hardware. With only two Android devices available to the team, testing was slow and required coordination.

Despite these limitations, this part of the project helped me better understand how user input, AR tracking, and object transformations interact in a real AR environment.

Towards the end of the project, I also helped integrate a **second anatomical model (the kidney)** into the application. This process confirmed that the interaction and rotation systems were reusable and worked consistently across multiple models.

Seeing the same logic applied successfully to more than one model helped validate the overall structure of the application and demonstrated that the system could be expanded further if needed.

### Collaboration, Integration, and Merging

A significant part of my contribution was working together with **Samuele on merging and integrating** the project. As different features were developed on separate branches, combining them into a single working AR scene required careful coordination.

We spent a large amount of time fixing issues caused by merges, such as broken references, conflicting scripts, and unexpected behavior after integration. In later stages, Samuele and I worked together on the same setup due to Unity package issues on his machine, which required close collaboration and shared problem-solving.

This experience made it clear that merging is not only a technical task, but also a collaborative process that depends on communication and coordination.

## Conclusion

This AR project was an important learning experience for me. Starting without prior Unity knowledge, I was able to contribute to core interaction systems, model integration, and take shared responsibility for merging and stabilizing the project. Working closely with Samuele on integration and debugging strengthened both my technical understanding and collaboration skills.

Overall, the project helped me understand how the different components of an AR application come together in Unity, and how testing, merging, and teamwork are essential to building a functional AR experience.
