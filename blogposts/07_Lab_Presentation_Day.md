# 🧪 Lab Presentation Day – SARA AR Project

Today we presented the final version of our **SARA – AR Biology Visualizer** during the XR Development Lab Session.  
Our teachers and classmates watched the demonstration video showcasing the functionality and user experience of our AR anatomy application.

## 🎥 What We Presented

During the session, we walked through the major features of the application:

- 🦴 **3D Skull Model** anchored to a tracked image  
- 🩺 **3D Kidney Model** integrated using the same system  
- 💬 **Interactive Annotations** with expanding explanations  
- 🔄 **Smooth rotation and zoom gestures** for inspection  
- ♻️ **Reset functionality** for returning the model to its original state  
- 📱 **Reliable AR tracking** using AR Foundation  

The video clearly demonstrated the workflow from scanning the image marker to interacting with the anatomical models.

## 🌟 Outcome

The presentation went smoothly, and the application performed exactly as expected —  
reflecting the work we had completed well in advance of the lab session.

Our peers and teachers were able to see:

- A stable and polished AR prototype  
- Consistent interactions  
- Clean integration of annotations  
- Good visual clarity of both the skull and kidney models  

There were **no issues or unexpected behavior** during the demonstration, confirming the robustness of our final build.

## 🧭 Final Thoughts

The Lab Presentation marked the conclusion of our AR development cycle for this project.  
It was a great opportunity to showcase the outcome of our teamwork and the technical decisions that shaped SARA into a functional educational tool.

The next step for us will be transitioning into VR development for our next project challenge.
