# 🎥 SARA – AR Biology Visualizer: Final Project Presentation

Welcome to the presentation of **SARA (Smart Augmented Reality Anatomy)** — an educational AR experience that brings 3D biological models to life through image tracking and interactive features.

This short video showcases the **final prototype** of our Augmented Reality application, developed collaboratively as part of our XR Development course.

## 🧠 Project Overview

**SARA** was designed to help students explore complex biological structures in a more intuitive and immersive way.  
By pointing a mobile device’s camera at printed image markers, users can spawn realistic 3D anatomical models that stay anchored to the physical world.

### ✨ Core Features Demonstrated in the Video

- 🦴 **3D Skull Model** with accurate spatial anchoring  
- 🫁 **3D Kidney Model** integrated through seamless image tracking  
- 💬 **Annotation System** – interactive hotspots that expand into detailed descriptions of each body part  
- 🔄 **Gesture Interactions** – rotate, zoom, and inspect models naturally with touch input  
- ♻️ **Reset Functionality** – return the model to its initial position and scale with a single tap  
- 🧩 **Multi-Model Support** – the system automatically switches between anatomical models depending on the tracked image

## 🌟 Reflections

Through this project, our team learned to integrate:
- Real-time image tracking and prefab spawning  
- Advanced input management and gesture-based interaction  
- Collaboration workflows with GitHub and Unity  
- The design principles behind user-centered immersive learning experiences  

SARA stands as our first fully functional Augmented Reality learning prototype — blending education, design, and technology to make anatomy exploration engaging and interactive.
